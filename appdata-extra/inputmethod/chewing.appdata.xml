  <summary>Traditional Chinese input method</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      The Chewing input method is designed for entering Traditional Chinese text.
      Chewing helps you inputting Traditional Chinese by its pronunciation, in the
      form of either Bopomofo/Zhuyin or Hanyu pinyin, as well as Chinese punctuation
      marks and normal and full shape number and English alphabets.

    <p>
      Input methods are typing systems allowing users to input complex languages.
      They are necessary because these contain too many characters to simply be laid
      out on a traditional keyboard.
